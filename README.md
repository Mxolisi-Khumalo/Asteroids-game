# Asteroids-game
The asteroids game made with python using the pygame module
The game you’ll be making is a clone of the classic arcade game Asteroids. In it, you control a spaceship and shoot asteroids. If your spaceship collides with an asteroid, you lose. If you shoot down all asteroids, you win!

Project Overview
Your Asteroids game in Python will feature a single spaceship. The spaceship can rotate left and right as well as accelerate forward. When it’s not accelerating, it will continue moving with the velocity it had. The spaceship can also shoot bullets.
The game will use the following key mappings:

Key                     Action
Right Arrow             Rotate the spaceship right
Left Arrow              Rotate the spaceship left
Up Arrow                Acccelerate the spaceship forward
Space Button            Shoot
Escape Button           Exit the game

There will also be big asteroids in the game. When a bullet hits a big asteroid, it will split into two medium ones. When a bullet hits a medium asteroid, it will split into two small ones. A small asteroid won’t split but will be destroyed by a bullet.

When an asteroid collides with the spaceship, the spaceship will be destroyed, and the game will end in a defeat. When all asteroids are gone, the game will end in a victory!
